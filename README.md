If you're gonna live, might as well live well. To live well is to lead one's own life, to tame the chaos in it. 

Taming your finances is living well. 
To be in control of your spending, your decisions, your mind. Modern society is very complicated, and so is your money's movement. Seeing where your money is flowing should be simple and beautiful. 

Virtuousity is living well. 
You should be capable of violence, yet not use it. The ability to say "no" allows you to be your authentic self. Say no to the tyrannical forces attempting you subjugate you. 
Only you can live your best life. 

Loving your work is living well. 
Most 17 year olds are forced to declare a major in college, basically having to choose what they want to do for the rest of their lives. How the hell is a 17 year old going to know what they want to spend the rest of their lives doing? Everybody has to work to earn a living, so might as well enjoy your work. Living a life well lived means doing great work, and the only way to do great work is to love what you do. 

Having good health is living well. 

Having healthy meaningful relationships is living well. 
A way to quantify trust. A social credit system to track a person's trustworthiness, strong moral character, dependability, honesty, ethics, modesty, humbleness, and good-heartedness. 

Living well entails having a good mentor. 
Schedle consulting sessions with real trades people and ask they what a jogf time.
