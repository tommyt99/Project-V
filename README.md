If you're gonna live, might as well live well. 
To live well is to lead one's own life. To be fully in control and tame the chaos in it. 

Taming your finances is living well. 
To be in control of your spending, your decisions, your mind. Modern society is very complicated, and so is your money's movement. Seeing where your money is flowing should be simple and beautiful. 

Understanding human nature is living well. 
Virtuousity. Philosophy. 
You should be capable of violence, yet not use it. The ability to say "no" allows you to be your authentic self. Say no to the tyrannical forces trying to subjugate you. Learn how to say no and stand your ground efficiently. Only you can live your best life. 

Loving your work is living well. 
Most 17 year olds are forced to declare a major in college, basically having to choose what they want to do for the rest of their lives. How the hell is a 17 year old going to know what they want to spend the rest of their lives doing? Everybody has to work to earn a living, so might as well enjoy your work. Living a life well lived means doing great work, and the only way to do great work is to love what you do. 

Having good health is living well. 
Your body has to be in good shape, and have the correct fuel to run and repair itself. 
Track your nutrition. Monitor your health. Get educated on healthy nutritious cooking with everyday affordable products. Connect with BLUEPRINT PROTOCOL and other biohacking sources. 
In order for your mind to be healthy, your body has to be healthy. 

Having meaningful relationships is living well. 
A way to quantify trust. A social credit system to track a person's trustworthiness, strong moral character, dependability, honesty, ethics, modesty, humbleness, and good-heartedness. 
{This isn't just another social networking gimmick. This is a way to reward the good people in the world, and warn everybody about the bad people in the world.} 

Mentorship and guidance can help you live well. 
Schedule consulting sessions practicing engineers working for large agencies, corpoations, or firms. Consult with professionals who work for themselves to learn how they did it.
